## üìÑ PRD: **Telegram to MT5 Trade Automation System (Codename: GoldMirror)**

**Author**: Adedapo Ajuwon
**Date**: 2025-05-17
**Stage**: V1 ‚Äî Personal use with SaaS-readiness
**Target User**: Active traders using Telegram signals, especially prop firm traders

### 1. üìå Problem Statement

Traders following high-performing Telegram signal providers often:

* Miss signals due to timezones or being offline
* Enter trades emotionally or inconsistently
* Violate prop firm rules due to poor risk management

The goal is to **automatically extract signals from a specific Telegram group** and **execute them on an MT5 trading account** with **safe risk rules, breakeven logic, and partial take-profit handling**.
